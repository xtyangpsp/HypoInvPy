C  LENG      DETERMINES THE NON-BLANK LENGTH OF A STRING.

C  JDATE     RETURNS DATE FOR A PERPETUAL JULIAN DAY.
C  OPENR  &  OPENS A FILE FOR READING.
C  OPENW  &  OPENS A FILE FOR WRITING.
C  ERRSET &  VAX SYSTEM SUBROUTINE ONLY: CONTROLS ERROR MESSAGES ON OVERFLOWS.
C               (A DUMMY ERRSET.F IS SUPPLIED WITH THE UNIX VERSION)
C  SPAWN  &  SPAWNS AN OPERATING SYSTEM COMMAND.
C  READQ  &  READS AN ASCII RECORD AND RETURNS ITS LENGTH.
C  GETENV &  ON UNIX, RETURNS ENVIRONMENT VAR W/NAME OF INI COMMAND FILE
C               (A DUMMY GETENV.VAX IS SUPPLIED FOR VAX & OS2 VERSIONS)

C--CUSP SUBROUTINES (NO LONGER NEEDED)
C  MEM_DUMP      READS A CUSP MEM FILE AND PUTS DATA INTO STRUCTURES
C  OPHASE      PARSES REMARK, WEIGHT & FIRST MOT FROM PHASE DESCRIPTOR
C  MEM_EQ_UPDATE  PUTS HYPOCENTER & STA INFO INTO CUSP MEMORY (& MEM FILE)

C--DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VAX AND SUN/UNIX VERSIONS:
C--WHERE THEY DIFFER, THE SUBROUTINE SOURCE CODE FILES THAT END IN .F ARE
C  FOR SUN; THOSE ENDING IN .FOR ARE FOR VAX.  FILES FOR WHICH THERE IS
C  ONLY A .FOR VERSION WILL COMPILE ON EITHER MACHINE.
C--ROUTINES WITH DIFFERENT VERSIONS ARE HYBEG, HYDELT, HYEDIT, HYTIME,
C  SPAWN, INIT_EVENT, HYCIN, OPENR AND OPENW.
C--HYBEG INITIALIZES FILENAMES AND DEVICES THAT ARE SYSTEM SPECIFIC.

C--THE FOLLOWING "NON-ANSI" FORTRAN FEATURES ARE USED (THESE WERE FLAGGED
C  BY SUN'S FORTRAN COMPILER WHEN THE -ansi COMMAND FLAG WAS USED):
C    OPTIONAL INTEGER*2 AND LOGICAL*2 VARIABLES IN COMMON (SEE INTEGER.FOR)
C    INCLUDE STATEMENT
C    DO ... END DO STATEMENTS
C    ! TO BEGIN END OF LINE COMMENTS ('common.' FILE ONLY)
C    SUBROUTINE NAMES (HYPOINV) LONGER THAN 6 CHARACTERS
C    LIST-DIRECTED FORMATTING FROM AN INTERNAL STRING
C    CHARACTER*(*) IN CONCATENATION

C--FPE (FLOATING POINT EXCEPTION) TRAPS.
C  THE SUN VERSION, WHEN PRESENTED WITH UNDERDETERMINED EARTHQUAKES WITH FEW
C  READINGS, WOULD SOMETIMES ATTEMPT A ZERO / ZERO OPERATION IN HYSVD. THE
C  SOLUTION PROGRAMMED INTO HYSVD.F WAS TO TEST THE DIVIDEND AND DIVISOR
C  BEFORE DIVISION AND TO RETURN A ZERO QUOTIENT IF BOTH WERE 0. THE VAX DOES 
C  THIS AUTOMATICALLY. 0/0 ON THE SUN YIELDS AN IEEE NaN (NOT A NUMBER) WHICH
C  CONTAMINATES ALL SUCCEEDING VARIABLES THAT DEPEND ON THIS NUMBER. WHEN
C  EVENTUALLY USED AS A SUBSCRIPT, THE PROGRAM HANGS UNTIL STOPPED WITH ^C.
C--HERE ARE SUGGESTIONS TO TRAP FPE'S THAT WERE USED TO DETECT THIS 0/0 FPE.
C  ON THE SUN, COMPILE f77 WITH THE -g OPTION TO STORE LINE NUMBERS IN THE
C  SOURCE CODE. SUN DOES NOT PERMIT COMPILING THE MAIN PROGRAM WITH BOTH -g
C  AND A COMMON BLOCK, SO USE A DUMMY MAIN PROGRAM HYPMAIN.F:
C	CALL TRAPFPE
C	CALL HYPM
C	END
C--THE TRAPFPE SUBROUTINE ENABLES A IEEE HANDLER WHICH IS CALLED WHEN AN FPE
C  EXCEPTION OCCURS (0/0, OVERFLOW, ETC). THE HANDLER PRINTS THE HEX ADDRESS OF
C  THE CODE GENERATING THE EXCEPTION, THEN USE THE dbx DEBUGGER TO FIND THE
C  SOURCE CODE LINE NUMBER. ALTERNATIVELY, USE THE dbxtool WITH CODE COMPILED
C  WITH THE -g OPTION, AND GIVE THE dbx COMMAND
c	catch FPE
C	dbxenv case insensitive ALLOWS EXAMINING HI VARIABLES WITH dbxtool.
C--SEE SUN'S DEBUGGING TOOLS AND FORTRAN NUMERICAL COMPUTATION DOCUMENTATION
C  FOR MORE INFO.

C--REMOVAL OF UNNEEDED SUBROUTINES AND DATA TO SAVE MEMORY SPACE:
C--IF CUSP DATA WILL NOT BE USED (JCP 6 OR 7):
C    ELIMINATE THE CALLS TO INIT_EVENT AND HYCIN FROM HYP. ALSO ELIMINATE THE
C    SUBROUTINES CALLED BY HYCIN (SUCH AS GET_* & THE CUSP LIBRARY).
C    THE COMMAND FID WILL NOT THEN BE NEEDED. ALSO ELIMINATE THE VARIABLES
C    IRES, LCUSP & FORID FROM COMMON.
C--IF SHADOW PHASE FORMATS WILL NOT BE USED (JCP 4 & 5):
C    ELIMINATE THE VARIABLES KSHAD, KLSHA, LENSHA, SHADO, LSHA1 & SHAD1
C    FROM COMMON, AND REFERENCES TO THEM IN HYPHS AND HYLST.
C--THE NUMBER OF STATIONS ARE CONTROLED BY THE COMMON PARAMETERS
C    MAXSTA > MAXPHS > MMAX. THESE CAN BE MADE SMALLER FOR SMALL NETWORKS.
